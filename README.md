# 🧪 Cinematic Periodic Table (Plan A+)

A world-class, interactive 3D Periodic Table experience built with **Three.js** and **Vite**. This project pushes the boundaries of web-based visualization with a hybrid WebGL/CSS3D rendering engine.

## ✨ Key Features

- **🌌 Hybrid Cosmic Engine**: Dynamic, shimmering starfield rendered in WebGL that reacts to mouse movements and camera depth.
- **🧪 Elastic Spring Motion**: Layout transformations powered by spring physics (Snappy, weighted, and organic).
- **🎬 Cinematic Camera**: Weighted "Lazy Follow" camera drift that adds immense depth and life to the 3D space.
- **✨ Holographic Glare**: Every element card features a moving holographic shimmer effect and intensive glow on hover.
- **⚡ Interactive Detail View**: Deep dive into element properties with a beautiful, glassmorphic modal view.
- **⌨️ Universal Controls**: Full support for Mouse, Touch, and Keyboard (1-4 for views, Esc to close, Tab to navigate).
